# LastPass Menu
#   Uses rofi or dmenu (if rofi is not found) to select a LastPass account and
#   copy its password to the X clipboard using xclip.
#
#   If you add any command line arguments, then this script will suppress
#   the final information message telling the user that the password has
#   been copied to the clipboard.
#
# Convenience / security note:
#   This script does not pass --trust to "lpass login". To prevent lpass-cli
#   from asking you for a second form of authentication, please run "lpass login
#   --trust" in a console once to configure lpass-cli to trust your computer. Be
#   aware that this may expire after 30 days. You may add --trust to the "lpass
#   login" call in this script if you understand the security implications of
#   doing so.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - lpass-cli
#   - rofi or dmenu (prefers rofi by default if it is found)
#   - zenity
#   - Clipboard program compatible with "lpass show -c" (such as xclip)
